# Angular Firebase

This is a simple website that I built using the Angular framework to pass the Firebase exam. The main page is secured by a Google authentication for login, which is connected to a Firebase Realtime Database. Once logged in, quotes can be displayed and submitted. The user's data is stored in Localstorage.
